Automatically organizes your Downloads folder by file type into neat categories.

## Categories Created

- Documents/Personal (for manual sorting)
- Images (photos, screenshots)
- Videos (movies, clips)
- Audio (music, recordings)
- Archives (zip files)
- Software (installers, apps)
- Spreadsheets (Excel files)
- Presentations (PowerPoint)
- Code (programming files)
- Temporary (unknown files for review)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Download
Save `generic_downloads_organizer.py` to your Downloads folder

### Step 2: Run
**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 generic_downloads_organizer.py
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
python generic_downloads_organizer.py
```

### Step 3: Review
- Check the `_ORGANIZED` folder in Downloads
- Review files in `Temporary` folder manually

## What It Does Automatically
1. ✅ Tests with 3 files first to ensure it works
2. ✅ Counts files before and after to prevent loss
3. ✅ Creates organized folder structure
4. ✅ Moves files by type
5. ✅ Generates detailed report
6. ✅ Verifies no files were lost

## Safety Features
- Tests small batch first
- Never deletes files
- Creates detailed logs
- Stops if errors occur
- Backs up file lists

## Customization
Edit the `categories` section in the script to add your own file types or folders.

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator/sudo
- **Files won't move**: Check if files are open in other programs
- **Script won't run**: Install Python from python.org

## Results
After running, your Downloads will have an `_ORGANIZED` folder with all files sorted by type, plus a report showing what was moved.
