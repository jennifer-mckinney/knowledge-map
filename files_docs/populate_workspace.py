## Python
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Write docstrings for all public methods
- Use pathlib for file operations

## Git Workflow  
- Feature branches from main
- Descriptive commit messages
- PR reviews required before merge
- Squash commits on merge

## Documentation
- README in every repository
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- API documentation with examples
- Architecture decision records

## Testing
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for APIs
- Performance benchmarks

## What Worked Well
- Python-based file operations reliable
- Clear directory structure aided organization
- Automation reduced manual effort

## What Didn't Work
- Bash scripts with special characters failed
- Relative paths caused confusion
- Desktop storage caused system crashes

## Key Learnings
- Always use absolute paths
- Test with 3 files first
- Provide copy-paste Terminal solutions
- Documents in iCloud, not local

## Action Items
- Document non-standard paths
- Create reusable script templates
- Build error handling into all operations
