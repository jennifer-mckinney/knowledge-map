## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
#### Critical Bug Fixes (High Priority)

**BUG #1: Hardcoded Username Preventing Portability**
- **File:** `files_docs/deploy_mac.py` (line 17)
- **Issue:** Username was hardcoded as `/Users/jennifermckinney`, preventing script from working on other systems
- **Fix:** Changed to use `Path.home()` for automatic user detection
- **Impact:** Script now portable across all macOS systems
- **Code Change:**
  ```python
  # Before: home = Path("/Users/jennifermckinney")
  # After:  home = Path.home()
  ```

**BUG #2: Integrity Check Logic Inverted**
- **Files:**
  - `scripts_instructions/generic_downloads_organizer.py` (line 141)
  - `scripts_instructions/generic_documents_organizer.py` (line 152)
- **Issue:** Integrity check reported FAILED when file organization succeeded, and vice versa
- **Root Cause:** Simple equality check `original_count == final_count` was misleading after files moved to subdirectories
- **Fix:** Implemented proper integrity validation:
  - Check if any files disappeared from file system
  - Verify files in organized folders match moved count
  - Added detailed warning messages for missing files
- **Impact:** Users now get accurate success/failure reports after running file organizers
- **Code Change:**
  ```python
  # Before: integrity_check = (self.original_count == final_count)
  # After:
  #   files_disappeared = final_count < self.original_count
  #   organized_count = self.count_files(self.organized_path)
  #   integrity_check = (not files_disappeared) and (organized_count >= moved_count)
  ```

**BUG #3: User Input Blocking Automation**
- **File:** `files_docs/deploy_project_workspaces.py` (line 82)
- **Issue:** `input()` call prevented running script in automated workflows (CI/CD, cron jobs, etc.)
- **Fix:** Replaced interactive prompt with `--force` flag and `DEPLOY_FORCE` environment variable
- **Impact:** Script can now run unattended in automation pipelines
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  # Manual run (without force):
  python deploy_project_workspaces.py

  # Automated run (with force):
  python deploy_project_workspaces.py --force

  # Or with environment variable:
  DEPLOY_FORCE=true python deploy_project_workspaces.py
  ```

**BUG #4: Path Inconsistency (iCloud vs Local)**
- **File:** `files_docs/deploy_project_workspaces.py` (line 17)
- **Issue:** Script used local `~/Documents` instead of iCloud Documents path
- **Documentation Conflict:** `file_system_schema.md` specifies Documents should be at:
  - iCloud: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents`
  - NOT local: `~/Documents`
- **Fix:** Added iCloud path detection with fallback to local
  - First checks for iCloud Documents
  - Falls back to local Documents if iCloud not available
  - Ensures consistency with other scripts (`quick_deploy.py`, `populate_workspace.py`)
- **Impact:** Deployments now go to correct location for cross-device sync
- **Code Change:**
  ```python
  # Before: self.knowledge_map_dir = self.home / "Documents" / "_AUTOMATION" / "knowledge_map"
  # After:
  #   icloud_docs = self.home / "Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents"
  #   local_docs = self.home / "Documents"
  #   base_docs = icloud_docs if icloud_docs.exists() else local_docs
  #   self.knowledge_map_dir = base_docs / "_AUTOMATION" / "knowledge_map"
  ```

## Migration Notes

### For Users Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

**File Organizers (generic_downloads_organizer.py, generic_documents_organizer.py):**
- No breaking changes
- Integrity check now works correctly
- You'll see accurate success/failure messages

**Deployment Scripts:**
- `deploy_mac.py` now works on any user's system (not just `/Users/jennifermckinney`)
- `deploy_project_workspaces.py` requires `--force` flag if Project_Workspaces already exists:
  ```bash
  # Old behavior: Interactive prompt
  # New behavior: Use flag
  python deploy_project_workspaces.py --force
  ```
- Path detection improved - automatically uses iCloud Documents when available

**No Action Required:**
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing deployments continue to work
- New inline comments improve code readability

## Maintainer Notes

### Testing Recommendations
After applying these fixes, test the following scenarios:

1. **deploy_mac.py:**
   ```bash
   # Should work on any macOS user account
   python files_docs/deploy_mac.py
   ```

2. **File Organizers:**
   ```bash
   # Test with 3 sample files first
   python scripts_instructions/generic_downloads_organizer.py
   # Should show "‚úÖ PASSED" integrity check
   ```

3. **Workspace Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # First run (fresh deployment)
   python files_docs/deploy_project_workspaces.py

   # Second run (should require --force)
   python files_docs/deploy_project_workspaces.py --force
   ```

4. **iCloud Path Detection:**
   ```bash
   # Check which path is used
   python -c "from pathlib import Path; h = Path.home(); icloud = h / 'Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents'; print('iCloud' if icloud.exists() else 'Local')"
   ```
