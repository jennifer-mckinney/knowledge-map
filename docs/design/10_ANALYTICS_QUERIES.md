## Overview

This document contains SQL queries and analytics logic for extracting insights from the knowledge graph. Each query answers a specific user question and includes:
- **Question:** What the user wants to know
- **SQL Query:** Complete executable SQL
- **Expected Output:** Sample results
- **Visualization:** How to display results in UI
- **Insight:** What this reveals about user's work

## Query 1: What Am I Good At? (Strength Detection)

### Question
"What topics do I have the most knowledge depth in?"

### SQL Query
```sql
-- Find tags with most connected high-quality artifacts
WITH tag_stats AS (
    SELECT
        t.tag,
        COUNT(DISTINCT nt.node_id) as artifact_count,
        AVG(n.word_count) as avg_depth,
        SUM(CASE WHEN n.word_count > 1000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as substantial_docs,
        COUNT(DISTINCT r.target_id) as connection_count,
        MAX(n.date_modified) as recent_activity
    FROM tags t
    JOIN node_tags nt ON t.id = nt.tag_id
    JOIN nodes n ON nt.node_id = n.id
    LEFT JOIN relationships r ON n.id = r.source_id AND r.weight > 0.5
    WHERE nt.is_primary = 1
    GROUP BY t.tag
    HAVING artifact_count >= 3
)
SELECT
    tag,
    artifact_count,
    ROUND(avg_depth, 0) as avg_words,
    substantial_docs,
    connection_count,
    recent_activity,
    -- Strength score: weighted combination
    ROUND(
        (artifact_count * 0.3) +
        (substantial_docs * 0.4) +
        (connection_count * 0.3),
        2
    ) as strength_score
FROM tag_stats
ORDER BY strength_score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Expected Output
```

```

### Visualization
**Bubble chart:**
- X-axis: `artifact_count` (number of documents)
- Y-axis: `avg_words` (depth per document)
- Bubble size: `strength_score`
- Bubble color: Recency (bright = recent activity, dim = old)
- Label: `tag` name

### Insight
"You have **deep expertise** in machine learning (24 documents, 18 substantial) and ethics (19 documents). Recent activity in oxford-thesis shows this is your current focus area."

## Query 2: What Opportunities Am I Missing? (Cross-Domain Bridges)

### Question
"What knowledge from one domain could I apply to another?"

### SQL Query
```sql
-- Find cross-domain relationships with high weights
WITH domain_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        r.id as relationship_id,
        r.source_id,
        r.target_id,

        r.why_json,
        -- Get primary tags (domains) for each node
        (SELECT t.tag FROM node_tags nt
         JOIN tags t ON nt.tag_id = t.id
         WHERE nt.node_id = r.source_id AND nt.is_primary = 1
         LIMIT 1) as source_domain,
        (SELECT t.tag FROM node_tags nt
         JOIN tags t ON nt.tag_id = t.id

FROM domain_pairs
WHERE source_domain != target_domain
GROUP BY source_domain, target_domain
ORDER BY bridge_count DESC, strongest_connection DESC

```

### Visualization
**Network diagram (subset of main graph):**
- Show only cross-domain relationships with weight > 0.5
- Color nodes by primary domain
- Edge thickness = weight
- Highlight clusters with 3+ bridges (hot opportunities)

**Insight card:**
```
üí° OPPORTUNITY DETECTED
You have ML expertise AND business strategy knowledge.
Bridge: "ethics" concept
Potential: Apply ML fairness frameworks to business decision-making.
5 existing connections suggest this is viable.
```

### Insight
"You have **5 connections** between ML and business strategy, bridged by ethics concepts. This suggests an opportunity to develop business applications of ML ethics frameworks."

## Query 8: Idle Files (What Should I Clean Up?)

### Question
"What files am I not using anymore?"

### SQL Query
```sql

### Insight
"You have **20 files** not accessed in 90+ days with minimal connections. These are candidates for archival or deletion to reduce clutter."

## Implementation Notes

### Query Performance
All queries use indexes from `05_GRAPH_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`:
- `idx_nodes_date_modified`
- `idx_relationships_weight`
- `idx_node_tags_node_id`

Expected performance: **<100ms** for all queries on 10k nodes.

### Caching Strategy
- Cache query results for 1 hour (analytics don't need real-time)
- Invalidate cache when nodes/relationships modified
- Store cached results in `analytics_cache` table

### Frontend Integration
Each query returns JSON that maps directly to UI components:
- Tables ‚Üí DataGrid component
- Charts ‚Üí D3.js/Chart.js
- Cards ‚Üí Material-UI Card components

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
